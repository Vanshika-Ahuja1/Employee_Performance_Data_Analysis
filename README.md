In terms of productivity, engagement, retention, and business outcomes, employee performance is the key factor that determines an organization's success. It is critical for organisations to comprehend the factors that influence employee performance and attrition as well as how these factors relate to other employee attributes including role, education, and job satisfaction.

This dataset contains all the information required to identify the employees, including demographics, job roles, performance ratings, compensation-related information, and even job satisfaction indicators that can be used to identify underlying trends or insights. Additionally, organisations can utilise this information to make informed decisions about performance management, retention tactics, and hiring.
